# OpenTelemetry Course

Within this course you will learn how to use OpenTelemetry to instrument and observe a
simplistic service written in Python.
The course is organized in a step-by-step tutorial to guide readers from building the Python service,
over instrumenting the service with OpenTelemetry until deploying and running it within Google Cloud.
