# OpenTelemetry Course

This course shows how to use OpenTelemetry to instrument and observe a simple Python service.
The course is organized as a step-by-step tutorial to guide readers from implementing the Python service,
instrumenting the service with OpenTelemetry and finally deploying and running the service within Google Cloud Run.
